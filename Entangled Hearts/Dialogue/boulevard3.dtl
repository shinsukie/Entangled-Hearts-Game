vincent1: So? How’s this for clearing your head? Better than staying in and overthinking everything, right?
vergil1: Yeah, this helps.
stella1: You know, you don’t have to keep everything to yourself. If the nightmares are getting worse, you can tell us.
vincent1: Seriously Bro. We’re here. Hindi lang kami kasama sa gala, kasama mo rin kami kahit sa mabigat na bagay. You can tell us if you got a problem.
- Tell them
	vergil1: I see my mom in those dreams. She’s drowning, and I can’t do anything. I just stand there, watching her get swept away. Every time I wake up, it feels real. Like I’m reliving it.
	vincent1: Pauses, then sets his food down That’s… heavy, man.
	vergil1: It’s not just that. It’s my dad. He wasn’t there when it happened. He’s never here. Always working abroad. When my mom needed him the most… when I needed him the most… he was gone.
	stella1: Softly That’s a lot to carry on your own, Vergil.
	vergil1: I can’t forgive him. He wasn’t there to help save her. And now he sends money and calls like that’s supposed to fix everything?
	vincent1: Alam mo, galit ka kasi mahalaga siya sayo. If you didn’t care, you wouldn’t feel this way.
	vergil1: So what? Am I supposed to just let it go?
	stella1: Vergil. Hindi siya tungkol sa pagtanggap na okay lang ang nangyari. It’s about freeing yourself from the weight of that anger. Kasi habang buhat mo yan, ikaw rin ang hirap.
	vincent1: Tama si Stella. Hindi mo naman kailangan kalimutan o tanggapin agad. But carrying that anger around won’t bring her back, and it won’t fix what’s broken.
	vergil1: So what do I do? Just… move on?
	stella1: You don’t have to figure it all out right now. One step at a time. At kahit na mabagal ang proseso, nandito kami para sayo.
- Don't mind
	stella1: You’ve been quieter than usual. Are you really okay?
	vergil1: Yeah, I’m fine. Just… tired.
	vincent1: Raises an eyebrow Tired? You’re dodging. Come on, Vergil. What’s on your mind?
	vergil1: Shakes head, forcing a smile I appreciate it, guys. Really. I’m just not ready to talk yet.
	stella1: Pauses, then nods Okay. But when you are, we’ll listen. Walang judgment.
	vincent1: Yeah, man. Hindi ka nag-iisa. Tandaan mo yan.
vincent1: Alright, who’s up for round two?
stella1: Seriously? Vincent, hindi ka pa busog?
vincent1: Halo-halo na lang! Dessert is the best part of any meal.
vergil1: Shakes head, laughing lightly You never change.
